# The Python Guessing Game
This folder contains two scripts:
- Player guesses the Machines number (PlayerGuess.py)
- The Machine guesses the Players number (ComputerGuess.py)

Should be easy to increase the range in both scripts..
A "fancy" type effect have also been added to the script where the machine will try to find YOUR number, just to make it look like the machine is talking back to you.
